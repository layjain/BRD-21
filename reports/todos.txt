- visualization
    - gather vaccine data from 3 countries - USA, Israel, India
    - plot time series of cases and vaccinations since vaccines started 
    - derivative of total_cases = new_cases before and 3 wks after vaccination
      started 
    - quantify the drop in new cases after vaccination has started
    - provide mean time of case drops from start of vaccination = "effect time"

Parameters of SIR model
alpha         = temporary immunity rate (recovered to susceptible) 
beta1         = contact and infection rate of transmission per contact from
                infected class (can change dep on vaccine research)
theta         = transition rate of exposed individuals to the infected class
                (immune system's aukaat)
rho           = rate of first vaccination of susceptible or recovered and
                susceptible people (known as a function of time)
phi           = second vaccination rate (reciprocal is the time between two
                vaccinations)
chi           = probability of transmission per contact from exposed individuals
delta_i       = death rate for infected individuals (delta_2 is minimum)
phi'          = second vaccination rate of those who caught covid in between two
                vaccinations, > phi
