- develop SEIVR model
    - read paper
    
- visualization
    - gather vaccine data from 3 countries - USA, Israel, India
    - plot time series of cases and vaccinations since vaccines started 
    - derivative of total_cases = new_cases before and 3 wks after vaccination
      started 
    - quantify the drop in new cases after vaccination has started
    - provide mean time of case drops from start of vaccination = "effect time"
